    "> I chose to work on Ford GoBike or as it's now known as [Bay Wheels system data](https://g.co/kgs/jMbvkr), is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and it's owened by [**Lyft**](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/lyft-deploys-its-pink-wheeled-bikes-and-rebrands-ford-gobike-as-bay-wheels/). I decided to invistigeted the app data for 2019."
